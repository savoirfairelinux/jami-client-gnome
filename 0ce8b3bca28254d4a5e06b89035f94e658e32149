The reason is because the user may have several Ring accounts, and may change the active one, or even delete the one which is active when the wlecome view is drawn. You can use the \u0027get_active_ring_account()\u0027 function to see which Ring account is currently active, this is what is used to determine which RingID to display in the welcome view. The other option is to re-draw when the active accout changes, as is done with the GtkLabel (see lines 160 - 176).",
