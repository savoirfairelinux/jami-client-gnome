Transaltion guide:

The client uses gettext for translations, for a comprehensive guide see:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.htm

In order to generate the .pot (template) file with all the translation strings,
append all the filenames that require translation to POTFILES.in, then run the
following command:
xgettext -o ring-client-gnome.pot --keyword=_ --keyword=Q_:1g --keyword=N_ -D .. -f POTFILES.in

Replace the first 3 lines of the generated header with:
# Gettext PO translation template file for the GNOME client of the Ring project.
# Copyright (C) 2015 Savoir-faire Linux Inc.
# This file is distributed under the same license as the Ring package.

Then upload the generate file (ring-client-gnome.pot) to Transifex.com for
translating.

When the translation is ready for a given language, download it and rename it as:
po/<language>/ring-client-gnome.po

If it is a new language, be sure to add it to the list of languages to be
installed in the CMakeLists.txt file
