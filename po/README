Transaltion guide:

The client uses gettext for translations, for a comprehensive guide see:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.htm

In order to generate the .pot (template) file with all the translation strings,
append all the filenames that require translation to POTFILES.in, then run the
following command:
xgettext -d ring-client-gnome -o ring-client-gnome.pot -k_ -D .. -f POTFILES.in

Then upload the generate file (ring-client-gnome.pot) to Transifex.com for
translating.

When the translation is ready for a given language, download it and rename it as:
po/<language>/ring-client-gnome.po

If it is a new language, be sure to add it to the list of languages to be
installed in the CMakeLists.txt file
