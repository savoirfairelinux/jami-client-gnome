# Contributing to Ring Gnome

GNU Ring welcomes contribution from everyone. Here are some ideas if you want
to help:

## Packaging

The client needs to be packaged for any platforms.
If the project is not packaged for your distribution and if you want to help,
feel free to create a new package!

## Design

This client needs to be as accessible as possible. For this, we need people with
idea to improve the accessibility or the design of the client. Feel free to do
mock-ups or open a ticket here:
https://git.ring.cx/savoirfairelinux/ring-client-gnome/issues

## Documentation

The documentation must be the most up-to-date possible to help users, devs and
anyone who wants to get informations. This wiki is currently located [here](https://git.ring.cx/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/wikis/home).

## Testing

The client is under an heavy development with new features, bugfixes, etc.
Because communications software depends on a lot of conditions, we need people
to test and filling tickets when necessary. To submit a new bug, go to https://git.ring.cx/savoirfairelinux/ring-client-gnome/issues.
And try to make the ticket as helpful as possible, by giving as much as necessary details, scenarios to reproduce, etc.

See: https://git.ring.cx/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/wikis/Bug-report-guide

## Support

Helping users when they post issues or questions on a social network or IRC for example is appreciated. Thank you!

## Communication

Talk to Ring to other people is appreciated too!

## Translation

We are currently using [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/savoirfairelinux/ring/) to translate the client.

## Development

Finally and not the least, you can also try to develop new features for this client.
The best way is to communicate with current developers via the Contact section (see below)
or by filling a new issue [here](https://git.ring.cx/savoirfairelinux/ring-client-gnome/issues)
or by taking one. See the [`good-first-bug` label](https://git.ring.cx/savoirfairelinux/ring-client-gnome/issues?label_name%5B%5D=good+first+bug)
if you don't know where to start.
