ring-client-gnome
*****************

Ring-client-gnome is a Ring client written in GTK+3. It uses libRingClient to
communicate with the Ring daemon and for all of the underlying models and their
logic. Ideally ring-client-gnome should only contain UI related code and any
wrappers necessary for interacting with libRingClient.

Requirements
==================

- Ring daemon
- libRingClient (Qt5 version)
- GTK+3 (3.10 or higher)
- Qt5 Core

Compiling
==================

In the project root dir:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

Then simply run ./ring-client-gnome
