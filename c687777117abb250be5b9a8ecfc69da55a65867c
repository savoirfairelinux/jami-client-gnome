A user doesn\u0027t know (and should not know) what an \"account archive\" is, and doesn\u0027t know that it\u0027s already on his computer (so \"copy\" doesn\u0027t make sense, the proper semantic is \"export\").\nAlso there is no need for a separate button.\nThe file should be saved when the user clicks on \"save\" in the file saving dialog.",
