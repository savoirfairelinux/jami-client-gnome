# README - chatview

The chatview runs under a WebKit GTK view. It is written using web technologies
(HTML5/CSS3/JS) and is responsible for displaying everything that deals with the
navbar, the messages, and the message bar.

## Contributing - syntax

We have a set of ESLint rules that define clear syntax rules (web/.eslintrc.json).

You will need the following tools:

- ESLint (The pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX)
  https://eslint.org/
- ESLint HTML plugin (eslint-plugin-html)
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-html

Before pushing a patch, make sure that it passes ESLint:
$ eslint chatview.html

Most trivial issues can be fixed using
$ eslint chatview.js --fix

We will not accept patches introducing non-ESLint-compliant code.

## WebKit GTK

Everything runs under WebKit GTK, that is if you need to write browser specific
code, you will only need to support WebKit (CSS -webkit- prefix).

Do not use querySelector if getElementById or getElementByClassName can be used
instead. querySelector doesn't always make the code easier and has very bad
performances.
